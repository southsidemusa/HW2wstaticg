        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! 

            I'm Musa Qadir Bey, I have acquired many useful traits including; first and foremost considerable skill with computers (Windows, MAC, and Linux), a sharp whit when it comes to working with software applications, and I have great organization skills.

I started seriously working on computers when I was given a laptop for my graphic design program with Full Sail University in 2019 but was pushed in the direction of IT by my older brother. Despite being deprived of such a useful tool for so long, once I was given a personal laptop I did not want to stop exploring IT and not only how to use it but how IT worked and how I could use technology to make my life better and little more secure. I decided to pivot from working in physical security at Facebook and put my design program on hold to focus on learning more about IT.

Two years after getting that personal computer I completed a few milestones during the pandemic lockdown. I was gifted a Zotac mini machine from my mentor and older brother (Patrick Taylor, Security Engineer at Marqeta) and I completed the Google IT Support cert on Coursera. The mini machine was the start of my personal home lab and me figuring out the ins and outs of Linux basics and confidently navigating a Linux environment.

After months of applying the Google IT Support cert eventually helped me secure a my first full time salaried position at Spendgo, a loyalty rewards startup located in the dog patch neighborhood of San Francisco. During my time there I continuously l developed a growing interest in security after falling victim to a phishing scam that rerouted one of my bi-weekly paychecks to another account. I learned more about security, how to better secure networks and the types of attacks one can face in a role like mine through The Ethical Hacking Course provided by TCM Security..</p>
